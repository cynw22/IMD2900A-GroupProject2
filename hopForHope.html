When you receive a Giving Gertie, give it to people in need in your community OR give it to a friend or family member as a gift that keeps on giving – so they can pass on the bags to people in need in their community. When a Giving Gertie bag is given out, a connection is made between both people.</p>

                <p class="dropdown-item">Pat Riggins, has spent his career cooking high-quality food at some of Ottawa’s top hotels. When the pandemic hit, he wanted to share his love of cooking with the community here in Ottawa and Riggins Family BBQ was born. As a father of four daughters, yes, you read that right… FOUR daughters, Pat understands the pressure most families face juggling work and home life. Most people don’t have the time or ability to spend 18 hours cooking a brisket to perfection. With the uncertainty of lockdowns, he knew people needed food that was adaptable to pandemic restrictions.</p>
                <p class="dropdown-item">With Riggins Family BBQ, Pat found a way to deliver food to his loyal customers, and keep the quality for which he’s known. Riggins Family BBQ’s solution was to do cold food pickup and delivery, where he would prepare the food to its perfection, then quickly cool and Vac-Pack it with Riggins Family BBQ’s signature mop sauce. You can easily reheat your meal and enjoy at your convenience. Riggins Family BBQ’s products can be kept in the fridge or freezer until you want to enjoy them. Choose from six pre-made meal kits or build your own BBQ from their a la carte menu. Pat is so excited his family will be able to feed the community again!</p>

                    <p class="dropdown-item">Pat Riggins, has spent his career cooking high-quality food at some of Ottawa’s top hotels. When the pandemic hit, he wanted to share his love of cooking with the community here in Ottawa and Riggins Family BBQ was born. As a father of four daughters, yes, you read that right… FOUR daughters, Pat understands the pressure most families face juggling work and home life. Most people don’t have the time or ability to spend 18 hours cooking a brisket to perfection. With the uncertainty of lockdowns, he knew people needed food that was adaptable to pandemic restrictions.</p>
                    <p class="dropdown-item">With Riggins Family BBQ, Pat found a way to deliver food to his loyal customers, and keep the quality for which he’s known. Riggins Family BBQ’s solution was to do cold food pickup and delivery, where he would prepare the food to its perfection, then quickly cool and Vac-Pack it with Riggins Family BBQ’s signature mop sauce. You can easily reheat your meal and enjoy at your convenience. Riggins Family BBQ’s products can be kept in the fridge or freezer until you want to enjoy them. Choose from six pre-made meal kits or build your own BBQ from their a la carte menu. Pat is so excited his family will be able to feed the community again!</p>
